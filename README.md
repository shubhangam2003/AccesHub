# Overall Description of the Project
# Project Background
In an increasingly digital world, inclusivity is paramount. Our project addresses the digital accessibility gap by designing a web page tailored for individuals with visual impairments. The inspiration stems from the desire to provide an enriching online experience that caters to the diverse needs of this demographic. As technology advances, it is imperative to ensure that everyone, regardless of physical abilities, can seamlessly navigate the web and engage with digital content.

# Project Objectives
Our project has clear and defined objectives, aligning with the overarching goal of enhancing accessibility for visually impaired individuals:

	Voice-Controlled Interface: We aim to implement an intuitive voice-controlled interface, allowing users to navigate the web page effortlessly through spoken commands.

	Dynamic Text Presentation: To enhance readability, the project incorporates a dynamic text presentation feature. Selected content will be presented boldly, and users can personalize font sizes and styles to suit their preferences.

	Action Commands: Recognizing the importance of hands-free interaction, the project facilitates various actions such as adding, storing, and deleting content through voice commands, providing a seamless experience.

	Compatibility: The web page will be meticulously designed to ensure compatibility with screen readers and other assistive technologies. Cross-browser compatibility is prioritized to accommodate user preferences.
